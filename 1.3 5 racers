1.3 Five Bikers Compete in a race such that they drive at a constant speed which may or may not be the same as the other. To qualify the race, the speed of a racer must be more than the 
average speed of all 5 racers. Take as input the speed of each racer and print back the speed of qualifying racers. 

import java.util.Scanner;
class Racers {
 	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		float r1,r2,r3,r4,r5;
            System.out.println("Enter racer 1 speed");
		r1 = s.nextFloat();
            System.out.println("Enter racer 2 speed");
		r2 = s.nextFloat();
            System.out.println("Enter racer 3 speed");
		r3 = s.nextFloat();
            System.out.println("Enter racer 4 speed");
		r4 = s.nextFloat();
            System.out.println("Enter racer 5 speed");
		r5 = s.nextFloat();
		double avg = (r1+r2+r3+r4+r5)/5.0;
		if(r1>avg) 
			System.out.println("First Racer Qualified");
		if(r2>avg) 
			System.out.println("Second Racer Qualified");
		if(r3>avg) 
			System.out.println("Third Racer Qualified");
		if(r4>avg) 
			System.out.println("Fourth Racer Qualified");
		if(r5>avg) 
			System.out.println("Fifth Racer Qualified");
	}
}
